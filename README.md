# MiR-FLEET-PLC-Interface
MiR FLEET and PLC interface via Python Requests

MiR FLEET allows you to use REST commands to request informaiton and schedule missions.
I have setup a basic pallet swapping program that reads several PLC tags in order to schedule pallet pick/delivery missions.
The fllet_command module can be expanded with any of the REST commands available on the FLEET server.
