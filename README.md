# MiR-FLEET-PLC-Interface
MiR FLEET and PLC interface via Python Requests

Here is my python program that reads PLC tags and then schedules robot missions via the MiR FLEET.
I am utilizing the Pylogix library to read and write tags from an Allen Bradly PLC and
the Python Requests library to send REST commands to the MiR FLEET server.
